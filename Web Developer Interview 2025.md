4. **What is semantic HTML?**  
    Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` to improve readability and accessibility.
    
5. **What are void (self-closing) elements in HTML?**  
    Tags that donâ€™t need a closing tag, e.g., `<img>`, `<br>`, `<input>`, `<hr>`.
    
6. **What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute on images?**  
    It provides alternative text if the image fails to load and helps with accessibility.

14. **What are pseudo-classes in CSS?**  
    Pseudo-classes define special states:

15. **Difference between absolute, relative, fixed, and sticky positioning?**
    

- `relative`: Positioned relative to its normal position
    
- `absolute`: Relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
    
- `fixed`: Relative to the viewport
    
- `sticky`: Sticks within a scroll range
    

16. **What is specificity in CSS?**  
    It determines which style is applied when multiple rules match. Inline > ID > Class > Tag
    
17. **How can you apply the same style to multiple elements?**  
    Use a common class name and apply styles using `.classname { ... }`.
    
18. **How to import a CSS file into another?**

22. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**
    

- `var`: Function-scoped, hoisted
    
- `let`: Block-scoped, not hoisted
    
- `const`: Block-scoped, constant value
    

23. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**  
    Variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
    
24. **What are closures in JavaScript?**  
    A closure is a function that remembers variables from its lexical scope even when executed outside that scope.
    
25. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**
    
- `==`: Loose equality, converts types
    
- `===`: Strict equality, checks type and value

### ðŸŸ¢ **DOM & Events**

26. **What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?**  
    The DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure of HTML documents as a tree of objects.
    
27. **How do you access elements in the DOM using JavaScript?**  
    Using methods like:
    

- `document.getElementById("id")`
    
- `document.querySelector(".class")`
    
- `document.querySelectorAll("div")`
    

28. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**  
    Event delegation allows you to add a single event listener to a parent element to handle events from its children using `event.target`.
    
29. **What is event bubbling and capturing?**
    

- **Bubbling**: Event flows from the target element up to the root.
    
- **Capturing**: Event flows from the root down to the target.
    

30. **How to prevent event bubbling?**  
    Use `event.stopPropagation()` to stop the event from propagating further.
    
31. **What is `addEventListener` and its syntax?**  
    Adds an event listener to an element:
    

js

CopyEdit

`element.addEventListener('click', functionName);`

32. **How to remove an event listener?**  
    Use `removeEventListener()` with the same function reference:
    

js

CopyEdit

`element.removeEventListener('click', functionName);`

33. **What are different types of DOM events?**  
    Common events include:
    

- `click`
    
- `keydown`, `keyup`
    
- `submit`
    
- `change`
    
- `mouseover`, `mouseout`
    

34. **What is the difference between `innerHTML` and `textContent`?**
    

- `innerHTML`: Parses and renders HTML
    
- `textContent`: Only gets/sets plain text
    

35. **How to dynamically create an element in JavaScript?**
    `const div = document.createElement('div'); div.textContent = 'Hello'; document.body.appendChild(div);`

### ðŸ”µ **Git & Version Control**

36. **What is Git?**  
    Git is a distributed version control system for tracking code changes during software development.
    
37. **What is GitHub?**  
    GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories and collaborate on projects.
    
38. **What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?**
    

- `git fetch`: Gets changes from the remote but doesnâ€™t merge
    
- `git pull`: Fetches + merges changes into current branch
    

39. **How do you resolve a merge conflict in Git?**
    

- Edit the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
    
- Save and stage the file
    
- Run `git commit`
    

40. **What is a Git branch?**  
    A branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit, used for parallel development.
    
41. **What is the purpose of `.gitignore` file?**  
    It tells Git which files/folders to ignore and not track (e.g., `node_modules/`, `.env`).
    
42. **How do you clone a Git repository?**
    `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`

43. **What is the command to initialize a Git repository?**
    `git init`

44. **How to stage and commit files in Git?**
    `git add .   git commit -m "Commit message"`

45. **What is `git status` used for?**  
    It shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.
