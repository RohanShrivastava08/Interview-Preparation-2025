1. **What is HTML?**  
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
    
2. **What are HTML tags?**  
    Tags define elements in HTML, usually with an opening (`<tag>`) and closing (`</tag>`) syntax.
    
3. **What is the difference between HTML4 and HTML5?**  
    HTML5 introduced new semantic elements (`<article>`, `<section>`), multimedia support (`<audio>`, `<video>`), and APIs like localStorage and geolocation.
    
4. **What is semantic HTML?**  
    Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` to improve readability and accessibility.
    
5. **What are void (self-closing) elements in HTML?**  
    Tags that donâ€™t need a closing tag, e.g., `<img>`, `<br>`, `<input>`, `<hr>`.
    
6. **What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute on images?**  
    It provides alternative text if the image fails to load and helps with accessibility.
    
7. **What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`?**  
    `<div>` is a block-level element, while `<span>` is an inline element.
    
8. **What is the DOCTYPE in HTML?**  
    It tells the browser the version of HTML being used. Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>` for HTML5.
    
9. **Can you nest block-level elements inside inline elements?**  
    No. Block-level elements like `<div>` should not be placed inside inline elements like `<span>`.
    
10. **How do you make a hyperlink open in a new tab?**  
    Use `target="_blank"` in the `<a>` tag:
    `<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit</a>`
