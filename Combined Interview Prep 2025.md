## ✅ **HTML & CSS (Frontend Core)**

1. **What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**  
    HTML5 includes new elements (e.g., `<section>`, `<article>`, `<video>`), supports local storage, and provides better semantics and multimedia support.
    
2. **What are semantic HTML elements?**  
    Elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` that clearly describe their meaning in human- and machine-readable ways.
    
3. **Difference between id and class in HTML?**  
    `id` is unique and used once; `class` can be reused across multiple elements.
    
4. **What is the Box Model in CSS?**  
    It includes `content`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin` — used to calculate element dimensions.
    
5. **How does CSS specificity work?**  
    Inline > ID selectors > Class selectors > Element selectors. More specific selectors override others.
    
6. **What are pseudo-classes in CSS?**  
    Keywords like `:hover`, `:nth-child()`, and `:focus` that apply styles based on element state.
    
7. **How do you center a div?**  
    Horizontally with `margin: auto;`, or flexbox: `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;`
    
8. **What is the difference between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?**
    
    - `relative`: relative to normal position
        
    - `absolute`: relative to nearest positioned ancestor
        
    - `fixed`: relative to the viewport
        
9. **What are media queries in CSS?**  
    CSS rules that apply based on device screen size, e.g., `@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }`
    
10. **What is the difference between `em`, `rem`, `px` in CSS?**
    

- `px`: fixed size
    
- `em`: relative to parent
    
- `rem`: relative to root (`html`) element
