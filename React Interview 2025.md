## ðŸ”¹ Section 1: React Basics (Q1â€“Q15)

### 1. What is React?

> React is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**, especially **single-page applications (SPAs)**. It uses a **component-based** architecture and a **virtual DOM** for efficient UI rendering.

### 2. What are components in React?

> Components are the **building blocks** of a React application. They can be **functional or class-based** and return React elements (UI).

### 3. What is JSX?

> JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows writing HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript, which gets compiled to `React.createElement()` calls.

### 4. What is the difference between functional and class components?

> Functional components are **stateless** and written as functions. Class components are **stateful** and extend from `React.Component`.

### 5. What is the Virtual DOM?

> The virtual DOM is a **lightweight copy of the real DOM**. React uses it to optimize rendering by updating only changed elements.
