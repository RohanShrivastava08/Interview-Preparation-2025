## ðŸ”· **SECTION 1: HTML, CSS, Browser (Q1â€“10)**

### **1. What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?**

**Answer:**

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is forgiving of syntax errors (e.g., missing end tags).
    
- **XHTML (Extensible HTML)** follows stricter XML rules: all tags must be closed, lowercase, properly nested.
    
- XHTML is stricter and better for data interchange; HTML is better supported by browsers.

### **4. What are semantic HTML tags?**

**Answer:**  
Semantic tags like `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<section>` define the **meaning** of the content.

### **5. How does `position: absolute` work in CSS?**

**Answer:**  
`position: absolute` positions the element **relative to its nearest positioned ancestor** (`relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`). If no ancestor is positioned, it's relative to the document body.

### **6. What are media queries?**

**Answer:**  
Media queries apply CSS rules based on **device characteristics** (e.g., width).

css

CopyEdit

`@media (max-width: 768px) {   .container { flex-direction: column; } }`

Used for **responsive design**.

### **7. What is the difference between SSR and CSR?**

**Answer:**

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** HTML is generated on the server (e.g., Next.js).
    
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** JavaScript runs in the browser and builds HTML dynamically (e.g., React SPA).
    
- SSR is better for SEO; CSR is better for interactive apps.

DOM (Document Object Model) is a **tree-like structure** representing HTML in the browser.  
JavaScript can use it to:

- Modify structure (`createElement`, `removeChild`)
    
- Update styles
    
- Handle events
