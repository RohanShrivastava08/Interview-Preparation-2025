A document is a JSON-like structure (BSON) that stores data as key-value pairs. Example:

json

CopyEdit

`{   "_id": 1,   "name": "Rohan",   "age": 25 }`

---

### 5. **What is a collection in MongoDB?**

A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in RDBMS. It is schema-less.

---

### 6. **What is BSON?**

Binary JSON â€” a binary-encoded format of JSON used by MongoDB to store data efficiently.

---

- **Referenced**: Store related data in different documents and reference them (normalized)
    

Use embedded for tight relationships, referenced for scalability.

---

### 73. **When should you use embedded documents over referenced ones?**

Use embedded when:

- Data is accessed together frequently

MongoDB uses **multi-granularity locking**: it locks at database, collection, or document level to allow concurrent read/writes.

---

### 82. **What is `$facet` in aggregation?**

Allows multiple aggregations in parallel on the same data set.

js

CopyEdit

`{   $facet: {     stats: [{ $group: { _id: null, avgAge: { $avg: "$age" } } }],     list: [{ $sort: { age: -1 } }]   } }`

---

### 83. **How does MongoDB store data internally?**

---

### 88. **How does MongoDB perform horizontal scaling?**

Using **sharding** â€” partitions data across shards based on a shard key.

---

### 89. **Can you shard a collection after inserting data?**

Yes, but it requires:

---

### 96. **How to optimize a slow query in MongoDB?**

- Use indexes
