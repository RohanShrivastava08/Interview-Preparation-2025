### 1. **What is MongoDB?**

MongoDB is a NoSQL, open-source, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON format. It allows horizontal scaling and high performance.

---

### 2. **What are the key features of MongoDB?**

- Document-oriented (BSON)
    
- Schema-less
    
- High availability with replication
    
- Horizontal scaling with sharding
    
- Powerful querying with aggregation
    
- Indexing support
    

---

### 3. **How is MongoDB different from RDBMS?**

|---|---|---|
|Structure|Tables, Rows|Collections, Documents|
|Schema|Fixed|Dynamic|
|Joins|Supported|Limited (via $lookup)|
|Scalability|Vertical|Horizontal (Sharding)|

---

### 4. **What is a document in MongoDB?**

A document is a JSON-like structure (BSON) that stores data as key-value pairs. Example:

json

CopyEdit

`{   "_id": 1,   "name": "Rohan",   "age": 25 }`

---

### 5. **What is a collection in MongoDB?**

A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in RDBMS. It is schema-less.

---

### 6. **What is BSON?**

Binary JSON â€” a binary-encoded format of JSON used by MongoDB to store data efficiently.

---

### 7. **What is the default port of MongoDB?**

`27017`

---

### 8. **What are CRUD operations in MongoDB?**

- Create â†’ `insertOne`, `insertMany`

- Update â†’ `updateOne`, `updateMany`
    
- Delete â†’ `deleteOne`, `deleteMany`
    

---

### 9. **How do you insert data into a collection?**

js

CopyEdit

`db.users.insertOne({ name: "Rohan", age: 25 });`

---
