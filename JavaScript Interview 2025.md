### ðŸŸ¢ **Section 1: JavaScript Basics (Q1â€“Q20)**

1. **What is JavaScript?**
    
    > JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used to build interactive websites. It is dynamically typed, prototype-based, and supports OOP, functional, and imperative styles.
    
2. **Is JavaScript single-threaded or multi-threaded?**
    
    > JavaScript is single-threaded, using an event loop and callback queue to handle asynchronous tasks.
    
3. **What are data types in JavaScript?**
    
    > **Primitive:** String, Number, Boolean, BigInt, undefined, null, Symbol  
    > **Non-Primitive:** Objects (arrays, functions, etc.)
    
4. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**
    
    - `null` = assigned explicitly (absence of value)
        
    - `undefined` = variable declared but not assigned.
        
5. **What are the falsy values in JavaScript?**
    
    > `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`
    
6. **How does type coercion work in JavaScript?**
    
    > JavaScript automatically converts types during operations (`'5' + 1` becomes `'51'`).
    
7. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `==` and `===`?**
    
    > `==` compares with coercion, `===` compares without coercion (strict equality).
    
8. **What are template literals?**
    
    > Syntax: `` `Hello ${name}` ``; they support interpolation and multiline strings.
    
9. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**
    
    - `var` = function-scoped, hoisted
        
    - `let` = block-scoped
        
    - `const` = block-scoped + can't be reassigned
        
10. **Explain hoisting.**
    
    > Declarations (`var`, `function`) are moved to the top of their scope during compilation.
    
11. **What is NaN?**
    
    > Not-a-Number â€” a special value indicating an invalid number operation (`parseInt('abc')`).
    
12. **What is the difference between `typeof` and `instanceof`?**
    
    - `typeof` checks primitive types
        
    - `instanceof` checks prototype chain for object types
        
13. **What is the purpose of `isNaN()`?**
    
    > To check if a value is **NaN** after coercion.
    
14. **What is the use of `typeof null` returning `'object'`?**
    
    > It's a historical bug in JS.
    
15. **How do you check if a variable is an array?**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `Array.isArray(value)`
    
16. **What is the difference between `slice()` and `splice()`?**
    
    - `slice(start, end)` = returns a portion (non-destructive)
        
    - `splice(start, deleteCount)` = modifies original array
        
17. **What is `use strict`?**
    
    > A directive to enforce stricter parsing and error handling.
    
18. **What are higher-order functions?**
    
    > Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.
    
19. **What is the output of `typeof NaN`?**
    
    > `'number'` â€“ even though it's Not-a-Number.
    
20. **Explain the event loop in simple terms.**
    
    > JavaScript runs sync code, and async tasks are handled in the background. The event loop puts async results (callbacks, promises) back into the call stack via the queue.

### ðŸŸ¡ **Section 2: Functions, Scope, and Closures (Q21â€“Q40)**

21. **What are closures in JavaScript?**
    
    > A closure is when an inner function has access to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has returned.
    
22. **What is lexical scoping?**
    
    > Scope is defined by the placement of functions and blocks during code writing, not runtime.
    
23. **Explain IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `(function() {   // Code runs here })();`
    
24. **Difference between function declaration and expression?**
    
    - Declaration: `function foo() {}` (hoisted)
        
    - Expression: `const foo = function() {}` (not hoisted)
        
25. **What is function currying?**
    
    > Transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions with one argument each.
    
26. **What is a callback function?**
    
    > A function passed as an argument to another, to be executed later.
    
27. **What is the call stack?**
    
    > A stack data structure where JS keeps track of function calls.
    
28. **What is `this` keyword?**
    
    > Refers to the object from where the function is called. In global scope, `this` is `window`.
    
29. **What are arrow functions and their differences from regular functions?**
    
    - Short syntax
        
    - No `this`, no `arguments`, not constructible (no `new`)
        
30. **What is the difference between `.call()`, `.apply()` and `.bind()`?**
    
    - `call`: `fn.call(obj, a, b)`
        
    - `apply`: `fn.apply(obj, [a, b])`
        
    - `bind`: returns a new function with `this` bound
        
31. **What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?**
    
    > The time between entering scope and variable declaration where `let`/`const` cannot be accessed.
    
32. **What is recursion?**
    
    > A function calling itself to solve problems.
    
33. **How is memory managed in JavaScript?**
    
    > JS uses garbage collection; memory is freed for objects no longer reachable.
    
34. **What is the difference between pure and impure functions?**
    
    - Pure: No side effects, returns same output for same input
        
    - Impure: Causes side effects (e.g., modifies global variable)
        
35. **What are generator functions?**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `function* gen() {   yield 1;   yield 2; }`
    
36. **What are arrow function limitations?**
    
    > No `this`, no `arguments`, not suitable for methods or constructors.
    
37. **Explain `.arguments` object.**
    
    > An array-like object in normal functions that holds all passed parameters.
    
38. **Difference between global scope and block scope?**
    
    > Global: Accessible everywhere  
    > Block: `{}` enclosed, e.g. `let` and `const` follow block scope.
    
39. **What is shadowing in JavaScript?**
    
    > A variable declared in a local scope with the same name as one in outer scope.
    
40. **Can you create private variables in JS?**
    
    > Yes, using closures or ES6 classes with `#privateField`.

### ðŸ”µ **Section 3: Objects, Arrays, and Prototypes (Q41â€“Q60)**

41. **How do you clone an object?**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `const clone = {...obj}; // shallow`
    
42. **How do you deep clone an object?**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); // simple but loses functions`
    
43. **What is the prototype chain?**
    
    > Objects inherit properties from prototypes. The chain continues until `null`.
    
44. **What is `Object.create()`?**
    
    > Creates a new object with the specified prototype object.

    CopyEdit
    
    `get name() {...} set name(value) {...}`
    
46. **Difference between map() and forEach()?**
    
    - `map()` returns a new array
        
    - `forEach()` executes a function but returns `undefined`
        
47. **What is destructuring?**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit

    CopyEdit
    
    `const merged = {...obj1, ...obj2};`
    
49. **What are Symbols used for?**
    
    > Unique and immutable identifiers often used for private object keys.
    
50. **How do you iterate over object keys?**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `for (let key in obj) // includes inherited Object.keys(obj).forEach(...)`
    
51. **Explain object immutability.**
    
    > Using `Object.freeze(obj)` or patterns like Redux to avoid state mutation.
    
52. **Difference between shallow and deep copy?**
    
    - Shallow: Only top-level references copied
        
    - Deep: Nested objects are also cloned
        
53. **What is the use of `hasOwnProperty()`?**
    
    > Checks if a property exists directly on the object (not inherited).
    
54. **How to prevent object mutation?**
    
    > Use `Object.freeze()` or libraries like Immer.
    
55. **What is the difference between `in` and `hasOwnProperty()`?**
    
    - `in` checks own + inherited
        
    - `hasOwnProperty()` checks only own
        
56. **What is optional chaining (`?.`) in JS?**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `user?.address?.street`
    
57. **Explain rest and spread operators.**

    - Spread: expand values â€” `{...obj}`
        
58. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`?**
    
    - Keys: returns keys
        
    - Values: values
        
    - Entries: [key, value] pairs
        
59. **What is a factory function?**
    
    > A function that returns a new object (used instead of classes sometimes).
    
60. **What is object destructuring with defaults?**
    
    js
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `const { name = 'Guest' } = user;`
