### üîπ General & JavaScript Basics

**1. What is the MERN Stack?**  
The MERN stack is a set of JavaScript-based technologies used to build full-stack web applications. It includes:

- **M**ongoDB (Database)

- **N**ode.js (JavaScript runtime environment)
    

---

**2. What are the advantages of using JavaScript across the stack?**

- Code reusability (same language for frontend and backend)
    
- Faster development
    
- Large ecosystem of tools and libraries
    
- JSON used throughout (MongoDB, Node.js, React)
    

---

**3. Explain ES6 features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and template literals.**

- `let`: block-scoped variable
    
- `const`: block-scoped, immutable variable
    
- Arrow functions: `() => {}` syntax with lexical `this`
    
- Template literals: Use backticks `` `Hello ${name}` `` for string interpolation
    

---

**4. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

- `==`: checks for value equality (performs type coercion)
    
- `===`: checks for both value and type (strict equality)
    

---

**5. Explain hoisting in JavaScript.**  
Variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during compilation. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.

---

**6. What are Promises and async/await?**

- **Promise**: An object representing eventual completion/failure of an asynchronous task.
    
- **async/await**: Syntactic sugar over Promises that allows writing async code in a synchronous style.
