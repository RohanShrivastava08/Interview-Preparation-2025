### üîπ General & JavaScript Basics

**1. What is the MERN Stack?**  
The MERN stack is a set of JavaScript-based technologies used to build full-stack web applications. It includes:

- **M**ongoDB (Database)
    
- **E**xpress.js (Backend framework)
    
- **R**eact.js (Frontend library)
    
- **N**ode.js (JavaScript runtime environment)
    

---

**2. What are the advantages of using JavaScript across the stack?**

- Code reusability (same language for frontend and backend)
    
- Faster development
    
- Large ecosystem of tools and libraries
    
- JSON used throughout (MongoDB, Node.js, React)
    

---

**3. Explain ES6 features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and template literals.**

- `let`: block-scoped variable
    
- `const`: block-scoped, immutable variable
    
- Arrow functions: `() => {}` syntax with lexical `this`
    
- Template literals: Use backticks `` `Hello ${name}` `` for string interpolation
    

---

**4. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

- `==`: checks for value equality (performs type coercion)
    
- `===`: checks for both value and type (strict equality)
    

---

**5. Explain hoisting in JavaScript.**  
Variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during compilation. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.

---

**6. What are Promises and async/await?**

- **Promise**: An object representing eventual completion/failure of an asynchronous task.
    
- **async/await**: Syntactic sugar over Promises that allows writing async code in a synchronous style.

### ‚öõÔ∏è React.js Basics

**7. What is JSX?**  
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML in React.  
Example: `<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>`

---

**8. What are components in React?**  
Components are reusable, independent pieces of UI. React apps are made up of components‚Äîeither functional or class-based.

---

**9. Functional vs Class components?**

- Functional: Simple JavaScript functions using hooks
    
- Class: Use ES6 classes with `render()` and lifecycle methods
    

---

**10. What is `useState` in React?**  
A React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component.

js

CopyEdit

`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

---

**11. What is `useEffect` used for?**  
Used to perform side effects (e.g., API calls, subscriptions) in functional components.

js

CopyEdit

`useEffect(() => { fetchData(); }, []);`

---

**12. How do you pass data from parent to child in React?**  
Using props.

js

CopyEdit

---

**13. What is the virtual DOM?**  
A lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React compares changes in the virtual DOM and updates only the necessary parts.

---

**14. What is the role of keys in lists?**  
Keys help React identify which items have changed, added, or removed in a list. It improves performance during re-renders.

---

### üü¢ Node.js & Express Basics

**15. What is Node.js?**  
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 engine. It allows running JS on the server.

- `findOne()`: returns the first matching document
    

---

**25. What is a collection?**

## üü° **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (1‚Äì3 Years) ‚Äî 40 Questions with Answers**

---

### ‚öõÔ∏è React.js Intermediate

**31. What are React Hooks?**  
Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Common hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo`, etc.

---

**32. Explain `useContext` and where you‚Äôd use it.**  
`useContext` allows you to access global values in any component without prop drilling.  
Example: managing theme, user login state globally.

---

**33. What is prop drilling and how to avoid it?**  
Prop drilling is passing props through multiple levels unnecessarily.  
Avoid with:

- `useContext`
    
- State management libraries like Redux or Zustand
    

---

**34. What is lifting state up?**  
Moving shared state to a common ancestor component so it can be passed down to children.

---

**35. Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?**

- **Controlled**: Form elements controlled by React state
    
- **Uncontrolled**: Form elements manage their own state via refs
    

---

**36. What are higher-order components (HOC)?**  
Functions that take a component and return a new component with additional features.  
Example: `withAuth(Component)`

---

**37. How does React handle forms?**  
Using controlled components. Form inputs are bound to component state and updated via `onChange`.

---

**38. What is conditional rendering?**

---

**39. How to optimize performance in React apps?**

- Code splitting with React.lazy
    
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
    
- Use virtualization for long lists (e.g., `react-window`)
    

---

**40. What is `useMemo` and `useCallback`?**

- `useMemo`: Memoizes expensive computed values
    
- `useCallback`: Memoizes functions to avoid re-creating them on re-renders

Use `$match` to filter and `$project` to shape the output:

js

CopyEdit

`{ $project: { name: 1, age: 1 } }`

---
